        <button onclick="setinfo('Project <b>GREEN</b> aims to provide more energy-effecent ways to power NSA. These include solar panels/wind mills, battery backups, and LED lights. The lights in classrooms and hallways are incandescant, which is verry inneficent and wastes 90% of power to heat generation.  LED lights spend more than 85% of energy to lighting, and last longer than other light bulbs. Battery backups can serve to help keep the school powerd during blackouts or lack of energy so that we dont have to use big generators. Solar panels or wind turbines can help decrease energy bills and amounts of carbon released into the air. All of these can contribute alongside other camaigns to make NSA a better school!');" class="infoButton" type="menu">Info</button>
